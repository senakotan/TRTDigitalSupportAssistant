# üéØ TRT Digital Support Assistant | RAG-Based Smart Q&A System

This project is an **AI-powered smart support assistant** built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, developed specifically for **TRT's corporate knowledge base**.  
The system **semantically analyzes** user questions in natural language and retrieves the most relevant internal content to generate **meaningful, context-aware answers** with the help of an **LLM (Large Language Model)**.

By combining **semantic search**, **vector-based retrieval**, and **LLM-powered text generation**, this assistant ensures **high accuracy**, **corporate consistency**, and a **seamless user experience**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture & Flow

1. **Question Embedding**  
   The user's question is transformed into a **dense vector representation** using **SentenceTransformers**, capturing semantic meaning rather than just keywords.

2. **Semantic Search**  
   The generated vector is compared against the corporate knowledge base stored in **FAISS** to find the **most semantically similar entries**.

3. **Context Creation**  
   Retrieved content is combined into a structured prompt, providing the **LLM** with the necessary background to craft a relevant and accurate response.

4. **Answer Generation**  
   The **Azure OpenAI-powered LLM** generates a **human-like, contextually relevant answer**, preserving the corporate tone.

5. **User Interface Presentation**  
   The answer is displayed in a **Streamlit-powered chat interface**, optimized for intuitive interactions.

6. **Interaction Logging**  
   All Q&A sessions are recorded via a logging system for **future evaluation, fine-tuning, and analytics**.
